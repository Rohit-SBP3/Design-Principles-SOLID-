/*** ....................Patterns Vs Principles.....................

                       Principles	                             Patterns
    Nature	           Fundamental rules/guidelines	             Proven reusable solutions to common problems
    Scope	           Universal (apply everywhere)	             Context-specific (solve particular problems)
    Flexibility	       Must generally be followed	             Can be adapted/modified
    Level	           Abstract (philosophical)                  Concrete (implementation-focused)

    Aspect	      Principles	               Patterns
    Purpose	      Prevent bad design	       Solve recurring problems
    Violation	  Leads to tech debt	       Just means you didn't use that solution
    Evolution	  Rarely change (timeless)     New patterns emerge (e.g., Reactive)
    Dependency	  Independent	               Often combine multiple principles

    When to Use What

     Use Principles When:
        Starting a new project
        Refactoring legacy code
        Doing code reviews

     Use Patterns When:
        You recognize a specific problem (e.g., need state management â†’ State Pattern)
        Optimizing for extensibility (e.g., Decorator Pattern)
        Standardizing team workflows
